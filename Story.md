## Story

Alice has recently started a business selling 3D printed jewellery for cats.

As you would expect business is booming and Alice wants to keep track of the success of the business with a metrics dashboard.

She is currently managing her orders in a spreasheet in Airtable, and would like to continue to be able to do so.

She would like her dashboard to contain some key figures, such as:

    • Total Orders
    • Total Orders this month
    • Number of orders in progress
    • Revenue
    • A list of the most recent few orders

..and anything else that you think that she may find useful.

Remember, whilst this is an internal tool for Alice and doesn't need to win any design awards,

You should take pride in the detail and keep in mind clean and maintainable code.

For ease of developement and deployment, we would like the application to be conatinerised using Docker.

Documentation for the Airtable API can be found [here](https://airtable.com/app8wLQrrIMrnn673/api/docs).

If you have any other questions please drop us an email anytime.
